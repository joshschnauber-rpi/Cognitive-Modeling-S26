Cognitive modeling is important for psychology and cognitive science because it can help us understand, simulate, and predict human cognitive processes. Because cognition is incredibly complex, attemping to understand and predict its behaviors by simply breaking it down to its base parts (e.g. individually firing neurons) is very difficult. So, instead we can use cognitive modeling to simulate human cognitive processes on a higher level.
